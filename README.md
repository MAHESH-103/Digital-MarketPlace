The case study outlines a project to develop a console-based digital marketplace application using Core Java, MySQL, and JDBC. Here's a detailed explanation of the procedure:

Step 1: Database Setup

- Create a MySQL database and four tables: Product, Seller,Buyer and Transaction(between seller & buyer).
- Define the columns as specified in the database schema:
    - Product Table: product_id (Primary Key), name, description, price, quantity_available, category
    - Buyer Table: buyer_id(Primary Key), name, email, address, phone_number
    - Seller Table: seller_id (Primary Key), name, email, address, phone_number
    - Transaction Table: transaction_id (Primary Key), product_id (Foreign Key), seller_id (Foreign Key), buyer_id (Foreign Key), quantity, transaction_date, status

Step 2: Java Application Setup

- Create a new Java project in your preferred IDE.
- Add the MySQL Connector/J library to project to enable JDBC connectivity.
- Create a new class, e.g., DigitalMarketplace, to serve as the main application class.

Step 3: Menu-Based Console Application

- Create a menu system using Java's Scanner class to read user input.
- Define menu options for product management, seller management, transaction management, and exit.
- Use a switch statement to handle user input and direct the program flow accordingly.

Step 4: Product Management

- Create methods for adding new products, viewing product details, updating product information, and deleting products.
- Use JDBC to interact with the Product table in the database.
- Implement exception handling for cases like duplicate product IDs or invalid input.

Step 5: Seller Management

- Create methods for registering new sellers, viewing seller details, updating seller information, and deleting sellers.
- Use JDBC to interact with the Seller table in the database.
- Implement exception handling for cases like duplicate seller IDs or invalid input.

Step 6: Buyer Management
    •  Create methods for registering new buyers, viewing buyer details, updating buyer information, and deleting buyers.
- Use JDBC to interact with the buyer table in the database.
- Implement exception handling for cases like duplicate buyer IDs or invalid input.

Step 7: Transaction Management
    •   Transaction Management method is created to understand the transaction between Seller and Buyer with the exact status
- Create methods for processing new transactions, viewing transaction details, updating transaction status, and refunding transactions.
- Use JDBC to interact with the Transaction table in the database.
- Implement exception handling for cases like invalid product or seller IDs, insufficient product quantity, or failed transactions.

Step 8: JDBC Connectivity and Queries

- Establish a connection to the MySQL database using JDBC.
- Create prepared statements for executing SQL queries.
- Use parameterized queries to prevent SQL injection attacks.

Step 9: Error Handling and Debugging

- Implement try-catch blocks to handle exceptions and provide user-friendly error messages.
- Use logging mechanisms like Log4j or Java Util Logging to log errors and debug information.

Step 10: Code Organization and Documentation

- Organize code into logical classes and methods.
- Use JavaDoc comments to document classes, methods, and variables.
- Follow standard coding conventions and best practices.

Step 11: Testing and Deployment

- Test the application thoroughly to ensure it meets the requirements.
- Deploy the application to a production environment.

By following these steps, you'll develop a comprehensive digital marketplace application that demonstrates your proficiency in Core Java, MySQL, and JDBC.
